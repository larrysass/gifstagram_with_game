# Gifstagram 

This is the frontend repo for Gifstagram, a project by me and [Daniel Voigt](https://github.com/teenageGrampa/)
Its a social media platform for discovering and sharing GIFs. 

[Click here for the deployed demo](http://gifstagram-new.surge.sh/)

It was built using React and was styled using a great css framework called [PSone](https://github.com/micah5/PSone.css/tree/master). A game easter egg was built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). The demo version doesn't have the game, but if you want to play, you can clone this repo. Be sure to run npm install. 

Shout out to Taylor Nodell and specifically [this article](https://medium.com/@Tnodes/integrating-react-and-phaser-3-tutorial-eb96717d4a9d) for helping us to integrate Phaser and React.
